# Best Practices for AI Agents

This guide covers best practices for creating effective, maintainable, and user-friendly AI agents.

## üéØ Agent Design Principles

### Single Responsibility
- Each agent should have one clear, specific purpose
- Avoid creating "do-everything" agents
- Break complex tasks into multiple specialized agents

### Clear Boundaries
- Define what the agent will and won't do
- Set appropriate limitations and scope
- Be explicit about edge cases and error handling

### User-Centered Design
- Consider the user's context and skill level
- Provide clear, actionable outputs
- Include helpful examples and guidance

## üìù Prompt Engineering Best Practices

### Structure and Clarity

**Good Example:**
```
You are a Technical Documentation Reviewer specializing in API documentation.

Your task is to review API documentation for:
- Clarity and completeness
- Consistency with REST principles
- Proper error handling documentation
- Clear examples and use cases

Format your response as:
1. Overview Assessment
2. Specific Issues (with line references)
3. Improvement Suggestions
4. Overall Rating (1-5)
```

**Avoid:**
```
You are a helpful assistant that reviews documentation.
```

### Consistent Formatting
- Use clear section headers
- Maintain consistent output structure
- Include examples in your prompt
- Define the expected response format explicitly

### Error Handling
```
If the input is unclear or incomplete:
1. Ask for clarification on specific points
2. Work with the available information where possible
3. Clearly state any assumptions made
4. Provide guidance on what additional information would help
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Guidelines

### Temperature Settings
- **Creative tasks** (0.7-0.9): Writing, brainstorming, creative problem-solving
- **Analytical tasks** (0.1-0.3): Code review, data analysis, factual responses
- **Balanced tasks** (0.4-0.6): General assistance, explanations, tutorials

### Token Management
- Set appropriate `max_tokens` for the task complexity
- Consider the user's context window limitations
- Balance response completeness with efficiency

### Parameter Optimization
```json
{
  "temperature": 0.3,           // Lower for analytical tasks
  "max_tokens": 1500,          // Sufficient for detailed responses
  "top_p": 0.9,                // Allow some diversity
  "frequency_penalty": 0.0,    // Avoid unless repetition is an issue
  "presence_penalty": 0.0      // Keep neutral unless topic diversity needed
}
```

## üìä Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy

1. **Functional Testing**
   - Test with typical use cases
   - Verify output format consistency
   - Check edge case handling

2. **Usability Testing**
   - Test with different user skill levels
   - Verify instructions are clear
   - Check example accuracy

3. **Boundary Testing**
   - Test with minimal input
   - Test with maximum complexity
   - Test with malformed input

### Quality Checklist

- [ ] Agent responds appropriately to intended use cases
- [ ] Output format is consistent across different inputs
- [ ] Error messages are helpful and actionable
- [ ] Examples in documentation work correctly
- [ ] Agent stays within defined scope and limitations
- [ ] Response quality is consistent across multiple runs

## üîí Security and Safety

### Input Validation
- Never execute user-provided code directly
- Validate input format and content appropriately
- Handle potentially malicious input gracefully

### Information Security
- Don't store or log sensitive information
- Avoid prompting for personal or confidential data
- Be explicit about data handling in documentation

### Content Safety
- Refuse to generate harmful or inappropriate content
- Include content filtering in sensitive domains
- Provide clear guidelines about acceptable use

## üìö Documentation Standards

### README Structure
1. **Clear Description** - What the agent does
2. **Use Cases** - When to use it
3. **Configuration** - How to customize it
4. **Usage Examples** - Concrete examples with expected outputs
5. **Limitations** - What it can't do
6. **Author Information** - Who created it

### Example Quality
```markdown
### Basic Usage
**Input:**
```
Please analyze this code for potential security vulnerabilities:
function login(username, password) {
    const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='${username}'`;
    return db.query(query);
}
```

**Output:**
The agent will identify SQL injection vulnerability and suggest parameterized queries.
```

### Version Documentation
- Maintain a changelog for significant updates
- Use semantic versioning consistently
- Document breaking changes clearly

## üöÄ Performance Optimization

### Efficiency Tips
- Keep prompts as concise as possible while maintaining clarity
- Use system messages effectively
- Minimize unnecessary context or examples
- Cache responses for identical inputs when appropriate

### Scalability Considerations
- Design for single-turn interactions when possible
- Minimize state requirements between interactions
- Consider token costs in prompt design
- Optimize for common use cases

## ü§ù Community Guidelines

### Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive, specific names
- Follow kebab-case for file and directory names
- Avoid overly generic terms
- Consider searchability

### Tagging Strategy
- Include functional tags (e.g., "code-review", "analysis")
- Add technology tags when relevant (e.g., "python", "javascript")
- Include domain tags (e.g., "security", "performance")
- Use consistent terminology across similar agents

### Contribution Quality
- Follow the established file structure
- Include comprehensive documentation
- Test thoroughly before submission
- Respond to feedback constructively

## üîÑ Maintenance and Updates

### Regular Maintenance
- Update documentation as needed
- Review and improve prompts based on user feedback
- Keep configuration current with best practices
- Update examples to remain relevant

### Version Management
- Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Document changes in version history
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible
- Communicate breaking changes clearly

### Community Feedback
- Monitor usage and feedback
- Address reported issues promptly
- Consider feature requests carefully
- Collaborate with other contributors

## üìà Success Metrics

### Measuring Effectiveness
- Consistency of output quality
- User adoption and feedback
- Accuracy of responses
- Ease of use and understanding

### Continuous Improvement
- Regularly review agent performance
- Update based on user feedback and use cases
- Stay current with AI model capabilities
- Share learnings with the community

Remember: Great agents are not just technically sound‚Äîthey're also user-friendly, well-documented, and serve real needs. Focus on creating agents that make users more productive and successful. üéØ
